Build a datamart from CSV files available on LinkedIn economic graph as well as other sources (ex: trending employers' websites) Use the datamart to create a dashboard allowing the analysis of this data. The dashboard must allow the analysis of trending jobs, skills and employers: 1) by region (Europe, America and Arab), by country, and by territory, 2) by year, by quarter, by month and 3) by industry. Other dimensions of analysis can be applied. The database must contain data covering the period December 2019 to May 2021. The dashboard must allow the comparison of trending jobs, skills and employees during the same period in two different years (eg January 2020 vs January 2021 or Q1 2020 and Q1 2021). It must also make it possible to compare between employers (size, turnover, etc.) Provide an update strategy.
